#### Step 1 - Prerequisites
In order to launch the solution you will need to have Node installed.
You can get latest version from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
After you download and install Node, you can proceed to next step.
 
#### Step 2 - Install dependencies 
Together with Node you will have `npm` - Node Package Manager, utility which will help you install all the dependencies.
Let's fetch all the required packages, by running in your preferred terminal the following command:

npm install
```

After the process is finished, you can run the server by running:
```npm start```
